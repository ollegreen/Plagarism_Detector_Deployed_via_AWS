# Plagiarism Detector - Deployed via AWS Sagemaker

## Result
- Built a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar the text file is to a provided source text.
- Built via AWS Sagemaker and their Notebook Instances, then deployed using S3 etc.

## 3 different notebooks:
1. Data exploration -- To get some general understanding of the data we are working with
2. Feature Engineering -- To create and adjust the data so it is able to be processed in our model in the 3rd notebook 
3. Training a Model -- Here the training and testing will occur to get our final results.

### NOTE 
- Not all files are uploaded, the rest is on the AWS notebook instance. This repo is for showing the final results.
